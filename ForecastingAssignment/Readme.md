# STA496 forecasting assignment
This folder contains the writeup and code used for my STA496 forecasting assignment. 
The assignment focuses on applying what I learned in STA303 about Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and what I have taught myself about Time series modeling, specifically ARIMA this summer in Python to produce a rough estimate of how former President Biden would have fared in the 2024 U.S. Presidential election if he had remained the Democratic nominee. 

🚫 📄**This is not a paper** 📄🚫
As stated above, this is not a formal paper. The purpose of this assignment was for me to apply what I know about GAMs and what I learned about time series. I did similar work with GAMs in STA303, but in R.

❗️**Disclaimer**❗️
I used the FiveThirtyEight uncorrected 2024 general election polling averages for this assignment; "Trump's margin" is simply Trump % - Biden % up to July 21, 2024. This data from FiveThirtyEight does not account for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s withdrawal and subsequent endorsement of Trump. This is an academic exercise, not a research paper claiming to estimate what would have happened in the 2024 election, had Biden remained the Democratic nominee.

## What I learned
- GAMs in Python using the `pygam` package
- Time series modeling
- ARIMA in Python using `statsmodels`
