# STA496 Learning Diaries
This is where I keep my learning diaries and research/reading notes from my readings course. There is no agenda for this but I thought it would be a good idea to document my learning.

This repo folder includes the following:
* **Learning Diary 1:** My research notes and learning process for the modeling assignment. This is where I practiced using the Python `pandas` package to clean datasets, connecting to google drive,
* and using `sklearn` to train and evaluate logistic ML models and `statsmodels.formula.api` to fit frequentist logistic models and perform likelihood ratio testing.
