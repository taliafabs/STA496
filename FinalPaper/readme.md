# Final Project 

My final project builds on my midterm paper in the following ways:
* Applying my modeling strategy to the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) and 2020 Congressional Election Study (CES) datasets.
* Reporting model performance on the 2016 CCES and 2020 CES datasets.
* Discussing what strong performance on two additional dataasets means for my project.
* Presenting my findings in a short video, intended for academic (but not necessarily statistical) audiences.


I've included a copy of my final paper in this folder, but it's probably better to visit my [LogisticVoteChoice](https://github.com/taliafabs/LogisticVoteChoice.git) project repo.
