The backward pass in your TensorFlow training loop happens here:

python
Copy code
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [model.W, model.b])
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [model.W, model.b]))
Explanation:
Forward pass:

python
Copy code
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    z = model(x_batch)  # raw logits
    loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_batch, logits=z)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)
This block computes the model's predictions (z) and the corresponding loss. TensorFlow "records" all operations on variables (model.W, model.b) inside the tape context.

Backward pass (gradient computation and update):

python
Copy code
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [model.W, model.b])  # this is the backward pass
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [model.W, model.b]))  # this updates the weights
tape.gradient(...) computes the gradients of the loss with respect to the model’s trainable parameters. This is where backpropagation (the backward pass) happens.

optimizer.apply_gradients(...) applies those gradients to update the model's parameters.

So the backward pass — meaning both gradient computation and weight update — is fully captured in those two lines.

Let me know if you'd like a visualization of how data flows through this loop or how GradientTape works internally!

ChatGPT said:
You're starting to implement L2 regularization, but your loop is incomplete — you're missing the actual loss computation, gradient calculation, and weight update that incorporate the regularization term.

Here's the completed and correct version of your loop with L2 regularization applied to the model weights during training:

python
Copy code
# L2 regularization
lambdas = [0.001, 0.01, 1]
validation_accuracies_regularized = {}
best_bs = best_accuracy[0]  # batch size
best_lr = best_accuracy[1]  # learning rate
best_ne = best_accuracy[2]  # num epochs

for lamb in lambdas:
    print(f"lambda: {lamb}")
    model = LogisticRegression()
    optimizer = tf.optimizers.SGD(best_lr)
    train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X_train, y_train))
    train_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10000).batch(best_bs)

    for epoch in range(best_ne):
        epoch_loss = 0
        num_batches = 0
        for x_batch, y_batch in train_dataset:
            with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
                z = model(x_batch)
                base_loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_batch, logits=z)
                base_loss = tf.reduce_mean(base_loss)
                
                # L2 regularization term (0.5 * λ * ||W||²)
                reg_loss = 0.5 * lamb * tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(model.W))
                total_loss = base_loss + reg_loss

            gradients = tape.gradient(total_loss, [model.W, model.b])
            optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [model.W, model.b]))

            epoch_loss += total_loss.numpy()
            num_batches += 1

        print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}/{best_ne} loss: {epoch_loss / num_batches:.4f}")

    # Evaluate accuracy on test set
    probs = model(X_test, train=False)
    y_preds = tf.cast(probs >= 0.5, tf.float32)
    accuracy_val = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(y_preds == y_test, tf.float32)).numpy()
    validation_accuracies_regularized[lamb] = accuracy_val
Key Edits Made:
Regularization term: 0.5 * lamb * ||W||² is added to the loss.

model.W is assumed to be the weight matrix (not bias).

The optimizer still performs the backward pass using the total loss (base + regularization).

Let me know if your LogisticRegression class defines more than just W and b, or if you want to apply regularization to other parameters as well (e.g. include bias or use L1 instead).







You said:
can l2 reg be added in here? logistic_model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy', 'loss']
)


ChatGPT said:
Yes, L2 regularization can (and should) be added inside the model definition itself, not inside .compile().

To add L2 regularization when you're using the compile() API (like with tf.keras.Sequential or a subclassed model), you must apply it to the layers of the model using the kernel_regularizer argument.

✅ Example:
If you're defining your model using tf.keras.Sequential, it looks like this:

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras import layers, regularizers

logistic_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(1, 
                 activation='sigmoid', 
                 input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), 
                 kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01))  # <--- L2 here
])
Then compile as normal:

python
Copy code
logistic_model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01),
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
Notes:
regularizers.l2(λ) applies 0.5 × λ × ||W||² automatically (this matches typical definitions).

The regularization penalty is added to the loss automatically during training.

The L2 penalty is only applied to the weights (kernel), not biases unless you also specify bias_regularizer=....

Let me know how you're building your logistic_model and I can tailor the example.

ChatGPT said:
Here’s a line-by-line breakdown of what each part of your logistic regression model is doing:

🔧 Model Definition
python
Copy code
logistic_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(1, 
                       activation='sigmoid', 
                       input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],) 
                       # kernel_regularizer = regularizers.l2(0.01)
                       )
])
keras.Sequential([...]): Creates a linear stack of layers. This model has only one layer, suitable for logistic regression (a linear model followed by a sigmoid).

keras.layers.Dense(1, ...):

Dense: Fully connected layer. Since it's Dense(1), it's outputting a single number per example, representing the predicted probability of the positive class.

activation='sigmoid': Applies the sigmoid function to the output, squashing it to a [0, 1] range. This is what makes it logistic regression.

input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],): Specifies the number of input features. This tells Keras what shape to expect for each training example (excluding batch size).

💡 You could uncomment kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01) to apply L2 regularization to the weights.

⚙️ Model Compilation
python
Copy code
logistic_model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01),
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy', 'loss']
)
.compile(...) tells Keras how to train the model:

optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01): Uses stochastic gradient descent to minimize the loss function. The learning rate controls how big the steps are in gradient descent.

loss='binary_crossentropy': The loss function for binary classification. It compares the predicted probabilities to the true binary labels (0 or 1).

metrics=['accuracy', 'loss']: In addition to minimizing loss, Keras will track and report accuracy and loss during training and evaluation.

🚂 Model Training
python
Copy code
logistic_model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
.fit(...) trains the model:

X_train, y_train: Training data.

epochs=100: Train for 100 full passes through the data.

batch_size=32: Break data into batches of 32 samples before updating weights.

verbose=0: Suppresses training logs (set to 1 or 2 to see progress).

During this process, TensorFlow automatically performs:

Forward pass (computing predictions),

Loss calculation,

Backward pass (computing gradients via backprop),

Weight updates using SGD.

🔍 Model Evaluation
python
Copy code
y_pred_prob = logistic_model.predict(X_test)
y_pred = (y_pred_prob >= 0.5).astype(int)
predict(X_test): Produces the predicted probabilities (values between 0 and 1).

(y_pred_prob >= 0.5).astype(int): Converts probabilities to class predictions (1 if ≥ 0.5, else 0). This is standard for binary classification thresholds.

📊 Performance Metrics
python
Copy code
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
classification_report(...) (from sklearn.metrics) prints precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.

✅ Summary
Step	What's Happening
Sequential	Builds the architecture
Dense(1)	One linear unit + sigmoid activation
compile()	Defines optimizer, loss, and metrics
fit()	Trains model with backpropagation
predict()	Gets output probabilities
>= 0.5	Converts probs to class labels
classification_report	Evaluates performance

Let me know if you want to visualize the model, track validation accuracy, or add regularization!







You said:
how do i see how loss and accuracy change over num epochs


ChatGPT said:
Great question! You can track how loss and accuracy change over epochs by saving the history returned by model.fit(...).

Here’s how to do it:

✅ Step-by-step: Track Training Metrics
python
Copy code
# Fit the model and save the training history
history = logistic_model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    verbose=0  # or 1 to see live updates
)
Now history is a History object that contains a dictionary of metrics for each epoch.

📈 Plotting Accuracy and Loss
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Extract metrics from history
acc = history.history['accuracy']
loss = history.history['loss']
epochs = range(1, len(acc) + 1)

# Plot accuracy
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(epochs, acc, 'b-', label='Training Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.title('Training Accuracy Over Epochs')
plt.legend()

# Plot loss
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(epochs, loss, 'r-', label='Training Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.title('Training Loss Over Epochs')
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
Optional: Add Validation Metrics
If you want to track validation loss and accuracy (recommended), pass validation data to .fit():

python
Copy code
history = logistic_model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
    verbose=0
)
Then you can also plot:

history.history['val_accuracy']

history.history['val_loss']

Let me know if you want to save this to a file, overlay training vs. validation, or track additional metrics!

ChatGPT said:
To show the confusion matrix as percentages rather than raw counts, you can normalize the confusion matrix by dividing each cell by the total number of samples (or by the sum over rows or columns, depending on the percentage you want).

Here’s how to modify your code to display percentages of the total samples in the heatmap annotations:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
cm_percent = cm / np.sum(cm) * 100  # convert counts to % of total

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
sns.set(font_scale=1.4)  # for label size

sns.heatmap(cm_percent, annot=True, fmt=".2f", annot_kws={"size": 12},
            cbar=False, cmap='Purples', 
            xticklabels=['Predicted 0', 'Predicted 1'], 
            yticklabels=['True 0', 'True 1'])

ax1.set_ylabel('True Values', fontsize=14)
ax1.set_xlabel('Predicted Values', fontsize=14)
plt.title("Confusion Matrix (%)", fontsize=16)
plt.show()
Explanation:
cm_percent is the confusion matrix normalized by total samples and multiplied by 100 to get percentages.

fmt=".2f" formats the annotations to two decimal places.

I added axis tick labels to make it clear which class is 0 or 1 (you can customize those labels).

If you want percentages by row (i.e., recall percentages), do this instead:

python
Copy
Edit
cm_percent = cm / cm.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True) * 100
Let me know which percentage style you want and I can adjust!








You said:
make it the total among that class


ChatGPT said:
Got it! To show percentages relative to each true class (i.e., each row sums to 100%), normalize the confusion matrix by rows like this:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
cm_percent = cm / cm.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True) * 100  # normalize rows to sum to 100%

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
sns.set(font_scale=1.4)  # for label size

sns.heatmap(cm_percent, annot=True, fmt=".2f", annot_kws={"size": 12},
            cbar=False, cmap='Purples', 
            xticklabels=['Predicted 0', 'Predicted 1'], 
            yticklabels=['True 0', 'True 1'])

ax1.set_ylabel('True Values', fontsize=14)
ax1.set_xlabel('Predicted Values', fontsize=14)
plt.title("Confusion Matrix (Percentages by True Class)", fontsize=16)
plt.show()
What this does:
Each row’s values sum to 100%, showing the percentage of samples within each true class classified into each predicted class.

This reflects class-wise accuracy and misclassification rates as percentages.

Let me know if you want help adjusting labels or styling!








You said:
round to two decimals


ChatGPT said:
You're almost there! To round to two decimals, just ensure fmt=".2f" is set in the sns.heatmap() call, which you already have.

Here’s the complete snippet again, with the rounding clarified:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
cm_percent = cm / cm.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True) * 100  # normalize by row (true class)

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
sns.set(font_scale=1.4)  # for label size

sns.heatmap(cm_percent, annot=True, fmt=".2f",  # two decimal places
            annot_kws={"size": 12},
            cbar=False, cmap='Purples',
            xticklabels=['Predicted 0', 'Predicted 1'],
            yticklabels=['True 0', 'True 1'])

ax1.set_ylabel('True Values', fontsize=14)
ax1.set_xlabel('Predicted Values', fontsize=14)
plt.title("Confusion Matrix (Percentages by True Class)", fontsize=16)
plt.show()
✅ This will display each value in the heatmap as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places.

To add a % sign to each annotation in the heatmap, you can format the strings manually. Here's the updated code with annotations showing percentages rounded to two decimals and including a % sign:

python
Copy

import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
cm_percent = cm / cm.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True) * 100  # normalize by row (true class)

# Format annotations with % sign
labels = np.array([[f"{val:.2f}%" for val in row] for row in cm_percent])

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
sns.set(font_scale=1.4)  # for label size

sns.heatmap(cm_percent,
            annot=labels, fmt="",  # fmt="" so it uses your custom strings
            annot_kws={"size": 12},
            cbar=False, cmap='Purples',
            xticklabels=['Predicted 0', 'Predicted 1'],
            yticklabels=['True 0', 'True 1'])

ax1.set_ylabel('True Values', fontsize=14)
ax1.set_xlabel('Predicted Values', fontsize=14)
plt.title("Confusion Matrix (Percentages by True Class)", fontsize=16)
plt.show()
Let me know if you also want to display the raw counts on top of the percentages!

This will display each value as e.g. 89.47% in the heatmap cells. Let me know if you want to add class labels or raw counts too.



is this ok? type(X_)
type(X_)
numpy.ndarray


ChatGPT said:
Yes, if type(X_) returns numpy.ndarray, then it is okay and compatible with PyMC — as long as:

It is a 2D array of shape (n_samples, n_features)

It contains numeric data only (floats or ints)

You use pm.math.dot() instead of np.dot() when doing operations inside the model context

✅ Check Shape
You can confirm it's properly shaped like this:

python
Copy
Edit
X_.shape  # should return (n_samples, n_features)
❗ Common Pitfalls to Avoid
If X_ is a pandas.DataFrame, you might get strange errors unless you convert it to NumPy using .values or .to_numpy().

If it has object or string dtypes, PyMC won't work — ensure it's all float or int.

Let me know if you want to verify the contents or structure of X_ before sampling.








You said:
X_.shape
X_.shape
(45636, 132)


ChatGPT said:
Perfect — X_.shape == (45636, 132) means you have:

45,636 observations

132 predictor variables (features)

This is a valid and well-structured input for your logistic regression model in PyMC.

✅ So your model line:
python
Copy
Edit
w = pm.Normal('weights', mu=0, sigma=1, shape=X_.shape[1])
is correctly defining a prior over 132 weights (one per feature).

And:

python
Copy
Edit
logits = pm.math.dot(X_, w) + w0
will compute the linear combination correctly, assuming X_ contains only numerical values.

If you're seeing good convergence from pm.sample(...), you're all set. Let me know if you'd like to:

Add interaction terms

Use informative priors (e.g. skeptical prior on biden_approval)

Check or visualize posterior predictions or coefficient uncertainty

    310             )


ChatGPT said:
The error you're seeing — KeyError: 'object' leading to a TypeError: Unsupported dtype — means that your design matrix X_ contains data with dtype object, which PyMC (via PyTensor/Theano) cannot handle.

🔧 Fix
You need to convert X_ to a numeric-only NumPy array, typically float64.

Here’s how to fix it:

✅ If X_ is a pandas DataFrame:
python
Copy
Edit
X_ = X_.astype('float64').to_numpy()
✅ If it's already a NumPy array, check dtype and cast:
python
Copy
Edit
print(X_.dtype)  # If this says 'object', fix it:
X_ = X_.astype('float64')
🧪 Tip: Check for Non-Numeric Columns Early
If you're building X_ from dummy variables or feature engineering steps, ensure:

All categorical variables are one-hot encoded

No mixed types (e.g., strings, None, booleans)

You can run this to find problematic columns (if you're starting with a DataFrame):

python
Copy
Edit
non_numeric_cols = X_.select_dtypes(exclude=[np.number]).columns
print(non_numeric_cols)
Once you've ensured X_ is a float64 NumPy array, rerun your model — this error will go away.

Let me know if you'd like help checking your original data pipeline.
