# STA496 modeling assignment
This folder contains the writeup and code used for my STA496 modeling assignment. The assignment focuses on building frequentist and ML logistic regression vote choice models using the 2024 CES survey dataset and investigating the effects of race on vote choice.

As stated above, this is not a formal paper. The purpose of this assignment was for me to learn about vote choice modeling, explore existing research, and practice coding in python. I previously did similar work in STA304 (but in R). This assignment really helped me learn how to use Python analysis in a reproducible paper (This is not exactly reproducible). I learned about predictors of vote choice, read and researched the race depolarization theory a bit, and got a lot of practice with the Python `pandas, `sklearn`, and `statsmodels.api` packages! I also got to read published papers in depth and enjoy them!
